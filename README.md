## ðŸ’¬ About me

#### My name is Mason, i'm a software engineer and a proud graduate of LearningFuze's full immersion coding program. I have an immense passion for coding, and learning process that goes into coding a project. My most recent project I am proud of was a full stack application that was built to assist medical patients in keeping track of their records (My-Health down in apps below ðŸ‘‡).

#### Before diving into software development I have 5 years of experience working as a medical assistant at an animal hospital. From that experience I gained the soft skills to effectively communicate and be a team player (as well as a team leader when needed). My years of honing my soft skills compliment my technical skills as well.


* ðŸ“š My tech stack is React.js, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
* ðŸ›  I use Bootstrap, npm, Babel, Webpack, Slack, and Photoshop
* ðŸŒŠ Outside of coding, I prefer to spend my time in the ocean, surfing
